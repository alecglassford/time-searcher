        <ul>
            <li>Drag boxes onto the grey canvas to filter stocks. Timeboxes select lines that are entirely within the box from left to right.</li>
            <li>Click near the middle of a timebox and drag to move it around.</li>
            <li>Click near the corner of a timebox and drag to resize it. The data is filtered discretely by weekly price, so if a box's width becomes thinner than 1 week, it will not filter at all and disappear once you stop dragging.</li>
            <li>Rolling over lines to view individual ticker symbols works better on <a href="?drilldown">the zoomed in chart</a> since there's less interference from other lines.</li>
